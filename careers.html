							<p>
								In the modern world, developing countries have been left behind for a multitude of reasons but in the modern world old technologies become more accessible, new technologies are developed, and technology as a whole becomes a necessity for anyone to compete as the quoted from the former U.S president Obama “The Internet is not a luxury, it is a necessity.” What does this spell for the developing world, specifically countries located in the geographical south, called the global south? Introducing technologies in the Global South can create obstacles for social equality that, when overcomed, creates massive benefits.
							</p>
							<p>
								As the citizens of the Global South gain access to new and important digital based jobs they aren't effective at it because they lack the familiarity with the technology associated with the jobs. The reason why these jobs are extremely important is because it increases the overall quality of life for workers in the Global South. As Harvard Business Review estimates, technology will create 12 million more jobs than it will actually destroy overall, increasing wages because of the new specialization (Nunes, 2021). These brand new jobs that are directly created by technology can allow developing countries a way to catch up to their developed counterparts as all the benefits will bridge the gap in standard of living.
							</p>
							<p>
								The issue that comes from new jobs created by technology is because they become inaccessible due to requirements to participate in them, such as understanding of the technology. According to the World Economic Forum 90% of all jobs will require digital skills in 10 years, this can be devastating to countries with low adoption of technology such as Ghana with 26% access to the internet and Pakistan with 8% (Eard & Guo, 2020). This information is corroborated as a report from the World Bank states that two-thirds of all jobs are susceptible to automation in the developing world. This will still take time since wages are extremely low and outpaces the cost of technology at this time(World Bank, 2016). There is a major gap between the population of the Global South having a general understanding of technology and the brand new jobs that require it because of the lack of access to technology.
							</p>
							<p>
								This issue of lacking experience with technology and the tools it provides can be overcome if the proper education is provided. According to the World Economic Forum, as the population of the Global South get their initial access to digital devices, such as cellular devices, they get access to E-Learning platforms which can lessen the barriers that come with traditional education for the developing world. The expense to education can be minimal while giving quality education, with up to a 25-60% improvement in retaining information and 40-60% less time required to learn if the initial effort is put in by the learner  (Eard & Guo, 2020). But still, there is the issue of the initial access to the internet, where, for example, in Indonesia only 1 ⁄ 4 of the population has stable access to the internet (Li & Lalani, 2020). As the population of the global south have increased access to technology and digital tools such as the internet, they can use E-Learning technologies as aid to understand newly introduced digital tools which can be incorporated into educational and job opportunities.
							</p>
							<p>Through all the issues, this new type of work created in a new digital environment is a net benefit to Global South if they overcome these obstacles. An example comes from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN, Introducing technologies to improve rural subsistence farming can expand out to become an agricultural business for their community. An example of this is in Tanzania through the Upscaling Agricultural Technology Extension Project which allows for SMS messages or radio broadcasts information about risks, pest management, and how to enhance production (Sylvester et al., 2021). The improvements to work environments can also extend to the medical sector such as according to this journal, introducing AI to the medical sector in the Global South can bridge the gap for healthcare quality in the developing world. Using AI can allow for quicker diagnosis, while lessening the cost for a professional. An example is that AI has a 90% detection rate in finding tumors in only 40 seconds, and as AI improves over time the detection rate will go up (Guo & Li, 2018). The proliferation of technology in the global south will create an overall positive shift in efficiency in their work, how much people can work in existing fields of work, and an ease for the workers if the technology is applied correctly. </p>
